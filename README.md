📊 Excel Projects Portfolio

This repository contains Excel projects I’ve built to practice data analysis, reporting, and automation. Each project is designed to turn raw data into meaningful insights using Excel features like formulas, PivotTables, and charts.

🔹 Projects

1. Payroll Excel Project

Description:
A beginner-to-intermediate Excel project to manage payroll data using formulas and logical conditions.

Key Features:

MIN, MAX, AVERAGE, SUM – Basic calculations.

Absolute Cell References – Keep key values fixed while copying formulas.

IF Conditions – Handle bonuses and conditional calculations automatically.

Purpose:

Practice organizing payroll data with dynamic formulas.

Learn how to combine basic and logical Excel functions.

Build a foundation for more advanced Excel projects.

Usage:

Open the Excel file.

Input employee data (salary, hours, etc.).

Formulas calculate totals, averages, min/max, and conditional results automatically.

2. Sales Tracker

Goal: Track and analyze sales data (products, quantities, revenue) over time.

Features:

Automated totals and summaries.

PivotTables for flexible reporting.

Charts to visualize trends and performance.

Skills Used: Formulas, PivotTables, Conditional Formatting, Charts.

3. Decision Factors ⚖️

This project is a basic Excel exercise where decisions are made by comparing values and choosing one over the other. Instead of using SUM, the project uses direct + operations to combine values step by step.

🚀 Features

Simple structure with manual decision-making logic.

Uses + instead of SUM() for clarity in basic calculations.

Demonstrates how to choose between values based on decision factors.

🧮 Key Excel Functions Used

Basic arithmetic (+)

Logical comparisons (choosing one value over another)

📈 Purpose

This project was mainly built as a starter exercise to understand:

How formulas behave when referencing values

How can decision-based outputs be represented in Excel.

4. Excellence Tracker

Goal: Monitor personal or team performance and productivity over time.

Features:

Scorecards for progress tracking.

Daily/weekly metrics logging.

Visualization of performance trends.

Skills Used: IF formulas, Conditional Formatting, PivotTables, Dashboards.

5. Employee Gradebook 📊

This project is an Excel-based employee gradebook that tracks test performance, calculates percentages, identifies top-performing employees, and automatically flags underperformers.

🚀 Features

Absolute cell references to keep formulas consistent.

Employee of the Month 🏆

Uses MAX inside XLOOKUP to find the highest performer and return their name.

Fired Employees ❌

Uses FILTER to list names of employees who failed performance conditions dynamically.

Performance Visualization

Clustered bar chart comparing employee scores across different tests (Safety Test, Company Philosophy Test, Financial Skills Test, and Drug Test).

🧮 Key Excel Functions Used

XLOOKUP() → to find Employee of the Month.

MAX() → to get the highest performance score.

FILTER() → to return names of employees flagged for firing.

& → to concatenate first and last names.

Absolute Cell References ($A$1) → to keep formula ranges stable.

📈 Insights

Instantly see who’s the top performer.

Automatically generate a list of fired employees.

Visual breakdown of employee performance through charts.

6.Sales Database 📊

This project is an Excel-based sales analysis system built from raw data into a structured and visual format. It demonstrates skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Excel’s built-in tools.

🚀 Features

Cleaned raw data using Text-to-Columns (split by space).

Applied Freeze Panes for easy navigation across large datasets.

Used SUMIF for conditional totals.

Applied SORT and FILTER for data management.

Built a Pivot Table to summarize sales data.

Created a Pie Chart to show sales distribution.

Designed a Clustered Line Chart for trend visualization.

🧮 Key Excel Skills Demonstrated

Freeze Panes for better usability

Text-to-Columns for splitting raw data

SUMIF for conditional calculations

Sorting & Filtering large datasets

Pivot Table for summarization

Charting (Pie + Clustered Line) for visualization

📈 Purpose

This project was designed to simulate a small sales database workflow:

Start with unorganized data

Cleaned it up for readability

Analyze sales performance using formulas & pivot tables

Present insights visually through charts

7. Excel Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how I processed and analyzed raw data from a .txt file using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to clean, transform, and visualize the data effectively while also creating a professional presentation of the findings.

🛠️ Steps & Skills Used

Data Import

Imported data from a .txt file.

Used delimiters to separate the data into proper rows and columns.

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Applied formulas for data manipulation:

LEFT() → Extract characters from the left.

RIGHT() → Extract characters from the right.

MID() → Extract substrings from the middle.

VLOOKUP() → Lookup values across tables.

IF() → Apply logical conditions.

CONCATENATE() → Merge multiple fields into one.

Analysis & Visualization

Built Pivot Tables to summarize the data.

Created Charts for visualization:

Scatter chart.

Clustered column chart.

Presentation

Exported the Excel analysis to MS Word for documentation and presentation.

8. Loan Interest Rate Calculator & Visualizer

This project is an Excel-based loan interest calculator that allows you to calculate loan costs at different interest rates and visualize them using a bar chart. It’s designed to help users understand how interest rates impact loan repayment over time.

Features

Interest Calculation: Compute loan costs using basic Excel operations like multiplication, addition, and subtraction.

Dynamic Visualization: Bar chart represents different interest rates and their corresponding loan costs.

Interactive Data: Easily update the chart by changing interest rates or loan amounts to see real-time changes in cost.

How It Works

Input the loan amount and interest rates in the Excel sheet.

Use Excel formulas to calculate the total cost of the loan for each interest rate.

The bar chart automatically updates to visualize the cost differences for each interest rate.

Adjust the interest rates or amounts to explore different scenarios.

Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Excel formulas: +, -, *, /

Bar chart visualization

9. Excel Shopping List Comparison

This project analyzes shopping list costs across three different stores and visualizes the results using Excel.

📌 Project Overview

The project focuses on calculating and comparing the total costs of shopping lists across multiple stores. Two different shopping lists were used (Susan’s and Tim’s), and bar charts were created to show price differences.

Steps Completed

Calculated the total cost at each store for Susan’s list.

Created a bar chart comparing the three stores (Walmart, Dollar Trap, and Office Repo).

Copied Susan’s list into a new column and updated it to represent Tim’s shopping list.

Adjusted item names and quantities for Tim.

Created another bar chart comparing store prices for Tim.

🛠️ Skills & Features Used

Formulas: SUM, cell references

Charts: Bar charts for store price comparison

Data Management: Copying, pasting, and modifying lists

Excel Basics: Formatting, alignment, organizing data

📊 Results

Generated total shopping costs for Susan and Tim at each store.

Built visual comparisons for both lists across three stores.
