📊 Excel Projects Portfolio

This repository contains Excel projects I’ve built to practice data analysis, reporting, and automation. Each project is designed to turn raw data into meaningful insights using Excel features like formulas, PivotTables, and charts.

🔹 Projects

1. Payroll Excel Project

Description:
A beginner-to-intermediate Excel project to manage payroll data using formulas and logical conditions.

Key Features:

MIN, MAX, AVERAGE, SUM – Basic calculations.

Absolute Cell References – Keep key values fixed while copying formulas.

IF Conditions – Handle bonuses and conditional calculations automatically.

Purpose:

Practice organizing payroll data with dynamic formulas.

Learn how to combine basic and logical Excel functions.

Build a foundation for more advanced Excel projects.

Usage:

Open the Excel file.

Input employee data (salary, hours, etc.).

Formulas calculate totals, averages, min/max, and conditional results automatically.

2. Sales Tracker

Goal: Track and analyze sales data (products, quantities, revenue) over time.

Features:

Automated totals and summaries.

PivotTables for flexible reporting.

Charts to visualize trends and performance.

Skills Used: Formulas, PivotTables, Conditional Formatting, Charts.

3. Decision Factors ⚖️

This project is a basic Excel exercise where decisions are made by comparing values and choosing one over the other. Instead of using SUM, the project uses direct + operations to combine values step by step.

🚀 Features

Simple structure with manual decision-making logic.

Uses + instead of SUM() for clarity in basic calculations.

Demonstrates how to choose between values based on decision factors.

🧮 Key Excel Functions Used

Basic arithmetic (+)

Logical comparisons (choosing one value over another)

📈 Purpose

This project was mainly built as a starter exercise to understand:

How formulas behave when referencing values

How can decision-based outputs be represented in Excel.

4. Excellence Tracker

Goal: Monitor personal or team performance and productivity over time.

Features:

Scorecards for progress tracking.

Daily/weekly metrics logging.

Visualization of performance trends.

Skills Used: IF formulas, Conditional Formatting, PivotTables, Dashboards.

5. Employee Gradebook 📊

This project is an Excel-based employee gradebook that tracks test performance, calculates percentages, identifies top-performing employees, and automatically flags underperformers.

🚀 Features

Absolute cell references to keep formulas consistent.

Employee of the Month 🏆

Uses MAX inside XLOOKUP to find the highest performer and return their name.

Fired Employees ❌

Uses FILTER to list names of employees who failed performance conditions dynamically.

Performance Visualization

Clustered bar chart comparing employee scores across different tests (Safety Test, Company Philosophy Test, Financial Skills Test, and Drug Test).

🧮 Key Excel Functions Used

XLOOKUP() → to find Employee of the Month.

MAX() → to get the highest performance score.

FILTER() → to return names of employees flagged for firing.

& → to concatenate first and last names.

Absolute Cell References ($A$1) → to keep formula ranges stable.

📈 Insights

Instantly see who’s the top performer.

Automatically generate a list of fired employees.

Visual breakdown of employee performance through charts.
